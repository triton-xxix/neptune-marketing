    <article class="content">
        <p>I've worked with dozens of businesses that have been burned by lead generation agencies. They all tell variations of the same story:</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "We paid them £5K/month for 6 months. They delivered leads, but none of them converted. When we tried to cancel, they pointed to the contract and said 'we delivered what we promised.'"
        </div>
        
        <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: <strong>Most lead gen agencies are built to sell leads, not generate revenue.</strong> There's a massive difference.</p>
        
        <h2>The Fundamental Flaw</h2>
        <p>Traditional lead gen agencies get paid for activity, not outcomes. Their incentives are completely misaligned with yours:</p>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>The Agency Incentive Problem</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You want:</strong> Revenue, customers, ROI</li>
                <li><strong>They get paid for:</strong> Leads generated, calls made, emails sent, ads clicked</li>
                <li><strong>The result:</strong> Volume over quality, every time</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>When an agency's compensation isn't tied to your revenue, they optimize for metrics that look good on reports but don't move your business forward.</p>
        
        <h2>Five Warning Signs Your Agency is Failing You</h2>
        
        <h3>1. They Lead with Volume Metrics</h3>
        <p>If your monthly report shows "427 leads generated" but doesn't break down:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many responded to outreach?</li>
            <li>How many booked meetings?</li>
            <li>How many became customers?</li>
            <li>What was the revenue generated?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>...then they're hiding poor quality behind big numbers.</p>
        
        <div class="stat-highlight">
            <strong>Reality Check:</strong> 500 cold leads that convert at 0.2% = 1 customer. 50 warm leads that convert at 10% = 5 customers. The agency will always choose the 500.
        </div>
        
        <h3>2. They Ignore Your Existing Database</h3>
        <p>This is the biggest missed opportunity in B2B marketing. Most businesses have thousands of warm leads sitting dormant in their CRM—people who requested quotes, attended webinars, downloaded content—but the agency focuses exclusively on cold acquisition.</p>
        
        <p>Why? Because "reactivating old leads" doesn't look as sexy on a proposal as "generating 500 new leads per month." But the math often favors the former.</p>
        
        <h3>3. No Follow-Up Infrastructure</h3>
        <p>The average B2B sale requires 6-12 touchpoints. Most agencies deliver 1-2 touches, then move on to the next campaign. They have no system for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nurturing leads over time</li>
            <li>Re-engaging non-responders</li>
            <li>Converting "not now" into "yes"</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>They treat lead generation like a transaction, not a relationship.</p>
        
        <h3>4. One-Channel Dependence</h3>
        <p>Agencies built on cold email or LinkedIn automation are fragile. When deliverability drops or LinkedIn changes their limits, your pipeline evaporates overnight.</p>
        
        <p>Real lead generation is multi-channel: email, SMS, phone, retargeting, content—all orchestrated to reach prospects wherever they are.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Fixed Retainers Regardless of Performance</h3>
        <p>If you're paying £5K/month whether you generate £0 or £50K in revenue, the agency has no skin in the game. They get paid even when you lose money.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "The moment we switched to a performance-based model, everything changed. Suddenly they cared about lead quality, conversion rates, and customer lifetime value. Funny how that works."
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Hidden Goldmine</h2>
        <p>Here's what most businesses don't realize: <strong>You probably already have enough leads.</strong></p>
        
        <p>We've analyzed hundreds of B2B CRMs. The pattern is consistent:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Companies have 5-10x more dormant leads than active prospects</li>
            <li>These dormant leads already know your brand (lower sales friction)</li>
            <li>They convert at 3-5x the rate of cold leads</li>
            <li>Reactivation costs 1/10th of new acquisition</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Yet almost no agencies offer lead reactivation as a core service. Why? Because it's harder to sell than "we'll get you 500 new leads." It requires better systems, longer time horizons, and patience.</p>
        
        <h2>What Real Lead Generation Looks Like</h2>
        
        <p>A proper lead generation system has four components:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Reactivation (The Foundation)</h3>
        <p>Mine your existing database first. These people already raised their hands—they're just waiting for the right follow-up at the right time.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Multi-Touch Nurturing</h3>
        <p>Not everyone is ready to buy today. Build systems that stay in touch with valuable content over months, not days.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Intent-Based Qualification</h3>
        <p>Stop treating all leads equally. Score and segment based on behavior, demographics, and engagement. Focus sales effort where it matters.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Aligned Incentives</h3>
        <p>Pay for results, not activity. When your lead gen partner only makes money when you make money, magic happens.</p>
        
        <h2>How to Fix This</h2>
        
        <p>If you're currently working with a lead gen agency, ask them these questions:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>"What percentage of the leads you generated last quarter became customers?"</li>
            <li>"What's the average customer acquisition cost from your leads?"</li>
            <li>"How many dormant leads do we have in our CRM, and what's your plan to reactivate them?"</li>
            <li>"Would you be willing to work on a performance-based model where you get paid per qualified meeting or closed deal?"</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>If they can't answer these satisfactorily, you're paying for activity, not results.</p>
        
        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        
        <p>Lead generation isn't broken. The agency model is.</p>
        
        <p>Most agencies are optimized for client acquisition, not client results. They prioritize case studies and pitch decks over sustainable revenue generation. They move from client to client, burning through databases and burning out sales teams.</p>
        
        <p>But when you align incentives—when the agency only wins when you win—everything changes. Suddenly lead quality matters. Follow-up systems get built. Dormant databases get mined. Revenue becomes the metric.</p>
        
        <p>That's the model we built Neptune Marketing around. Because we'd rather have a few clients who generate massive revenue than hundreds who generate impressive lead reports.</p>
