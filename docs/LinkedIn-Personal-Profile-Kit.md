## 2. About Section (Full Version)

```
Most businesses are sitting on £50K-£200K in untapped revenue — and they don't even know it.

Not from new ads. Not from new products.

Here's the truth:
→ The average business has 1,000+ dormant leads in their CRM

→ Cold email gets 2% response rates
→ Our AI SMS campaigns get 40%+

What we do:
✓ Audit your dormant lead database

## 8. Post Templates

### Template 1 — The Hook (High Engagement)

```
Most businesses are sitting on £50K-£200K in untapped revenue.

Not from new customers.
From leads they already paid to acquire.

Here's what I mean:

The average £1M+ business has 1,000+ dormant leads in their CRM.

These aren't dead leads.
They're dormant leads.

There's a difference.

Dead = never interested
Dormant = interested once, got distracted, still have the problem

We reactivate dormant leads using AI-powered SMS.

Results from last month:
→ 847 leads reactivated
→ 12 meetings booked
→ £14,500 in new revenue

All from a database the client was about to delete.

Your move:
1. Export your dormant leads (6+ months no contact)
2. Run them through a reactivation campaign
3. Watch your calendar fill with qualified appointments

Or DM me "REACTIVATE" and I'll show you exactly how.

#LeadReactivation #RevenueRecovery #B2BSales
```

### Template 2 — The Contrarian Take

```
Cold email is dead.

Not because email doesn't work.
Because inboxes are saturated.

The average person gets 147 emails per day.

Your cold email?
It's email #148.

But SMS?

Open rate: 98%
Response rate: 40%+
Read time: 3 minutes

Here's why SMS reactivation works:

✓ Personal — hits their phone, not spam folder
✓ Conversational — feels like a text from a colleague
✓ AI-powered — instant responses, 24/7
✓ Qualified — only books meetings with hot prospects

One client said:
"We got more responses in 3 days than we did in 3 months of cold email."

The leads aren't the problem.
The channel is.

DM me "SMS" if you want to see the exact scripts we use.

```

### Template 3 — The Case Study

```
Client: Operations Director, B2B services
Problem: 847 dormant leads, no re-engagement strategy
Solution: 7-day AI SMS reactivation campaign
Result: 12 meetings booked, £14.5K revenue

Here's the breakdown:

Day 1: Initial outreach
→ "Hi [Name], quick question about [Company]..."
→ 312 opens, 127 replies

Day 2-3: Conversational AI
→ AI qualifies interest, answers questions
→ 43 qualified prospects

Day 4-5: Booking
→ Calendar links sent to hot leads
→ 12 meetings booked

Day 6-7: Follow-up
→ Reminder texts to no-shows
→ 2 additional meetings

Total cost to client: £0 upfront
We worked on 50/50 revenue share

Their ROI: Infinite (no risk, pure upside)

This isn't magic.
It's a system.

And it works for:
→ B2B services
→ Financial services
→ Property/real estate
→ Professional services
→ High-ticket e-commerce

Got dormant leads?

DM me "REACTIVATE" for a free audit.

```

### Template 4 — The Personal Story

```
7 months ago, I made a decision.

I stopped chasing new leads.
Started reactivating old ones.

The result?
→ 40% response rates
→ Zero ad spend
→ 50/50 revenue share model
→ Happier clients (they only pay for results)

Neptune Marketing was born from a simple insight:

Businesses don't have a lead generation problem.
They have a lead utilization problem.

Your CRM is a goldmine.
You just need the right tools to extract it.

Today we help £1M+ businesses:
✓ Audit dormant lead databases
✓ Deploy AI SMS reactivation
✓ Book qualified appointments
✓ Generate revenue with zero risk

If your business has 1,000+ dormant leads...

DM me "AUDIT" and I'll show you what's possible.
No pitch. No pressure. Just a snapshot of hidden revenue.

## 10. DM Sequence (After Connection Accepted)

### Message 1 — Welcome (Send immediately)

```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

I help established businesses recover revenue from dormant leads using AI-powered SMS.

Not sure if that's relevant for you, but if [Company] has a CRM with old leads sitting around, might be worth a conversation.

How's [current quarter/season] treating you so far?
```

### Message 2 — Value/Case Study (3-4 days later, if they reply)

```
By the way — just wrapped up a campaign for a [similar industry] client:

• 847 dormant leads reactivated
• 12 meetings booked
• £14.5K in new revenue

All from leads they were about to delete.

Crazy what a simple SMS sequence can do.

Do you guys do any reactivation, or mostly focused on new lead gen?
```

### Message 3 — Soft CTA (If conversation flows)

```
Makes sense. Most businesses are acquisition-heavy.

If you ever want to see how much revenue is sitting in your dormant database, happy to run a quick audit (free, no pitch).

Takes 10 mins and I'll give you a snapshot of what's possible.

Worth exploring?
