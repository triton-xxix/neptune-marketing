## 5. Industry Selection

**Primary:** Marketing & Advertising  
**Secondary:** Management Consulting / Business Consulting

LinkedIn only allows one primary industry. Choose **Marketing & Advertising** as it best describes what prospects are searching for.

---

## 6. Company Size

**Display:** 2-10 employees  
**Actual:** Self-employed (Luke + contractors/VAs)

Reasoning: LinkedIn company pages with 2-10 employees appear more established than "1 employee" while still being authentic for a boutique consultancy.

---

## 7. Cover Photo Concept

**Dimensions:** 1584 x 396 px (LinkedIn recommended)

**Design Concept:**
- **Background:** Deep navy blue (#0a192f) to black gradient
- **Left side:** Large text "REVENUE RECOVERY" in bold white sans-serif
- **Right side:** Subtext "AI-Powered Lead Reactivation" in light blue/teal accent
- **Bottom:** Neptune trident icon (from logo) in subtle watermark
- **CTA button area:** "Turn dormant leads into revenue"

**Alternative text-based approach (if no designer):**
Use Canva template "LinkedIn Company Banner" — search "B2B technology" or "SaaS" templates, customize with Neptune colours (navy, teal, white).
