### OFFER STRUCTURE
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
**Hook** | "How I Make $1,000-$3,000 Per Day With Faceless Instagram Cash Pages"
**Price** | $6.95 (Normal $97) — **93% discount hook**
**Model** | Faceless Instagram theme pages (quotes, watches, houses, travel)

### TARGET AUDIENCE
- Want passive income without showing face
- No product, no upfront investment
- Can work from anywhere with smartphone
- Beginners looking for "autopilot" business

### RED FLAGS 🚩
- Extreme income claims ($18K+/week from one page)
- Heavy use of "autopilot" and "passive" language
- No mention of actual monetization method (affiliate? sponsorships?)
- Testimonial from "ALEN S." appears twice (duplicated)

### BOTTOM LINE
Classic "make money online" course targeting beginners with faceless content. The $6.95 price point is a tripwire to upsell later. Monetization likely through affiliate marketing or selling shoutouts.

## 2️⃣ AIGENCY VALET
**URL:** https://launchspecial.vip/av-specialpa/  
**Platform:** WordPress + JVZoo | **Traffic:** Launch special/affiliate

### OFFER STRUCTURE
| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
**Hook** | "AI Automation Engine That Finds, Learns About And Sells Clients For You"
**Price** | $297/year (73% off "early bird") — **~$81 one-time?** |
**Model** | AI-powered lead gen + outreach for agencies
**Client Target** | $500-$1,000 clients in any niche/location
**Key Promise** | AI hustles for you, closes clients while you sleep

### CORE FEATURES
1. **AI Lead Finding** — Finds local/national/global clients automatically
2. **Self-Training** — Studies prospects' business without manual input
3. **Decision Maker Detection** — Finds name, direct email, bypasses gatekeepers
4. **Profit Leak Identification** — Pinpoints business problems
5. **Auto-Pitch Writing** — Writes personalized outreach emails
6. **Client Closing** — System handles research, messaging, selling

### BONUSES (Stated Value: $261)
- Bonus #1: AI Chat Bot Detection ($97)
- Bonus #2: Multi-language Reports ($67)
- Bonus #3: Low Google Reviews Finder ($97)

### TARGET AUDIENCE
- Agency owners scaling client acquisition
- Freelancers wanting automation
- Side hustlers looking for "unfair advantage"

### RED FLAGS 🚩
- "Closes clients FOR YOU" — AI can't actually close sales calls
- Vague on HOW the AI trains itself (scraping? LLM prompts?)
- Heavy reliance on FOMO ("limited-time," "spots fill up")
- JVZoo platform = affiliate-heavy, potential quality issues

### BOTTOM LINE
This is a lead generation SaaS tool positioned as AI. Most valuable for Neptune Marketing — **directly applicable to our lead reactivation model**. The automation angle is strong, but claims of AI "closing" clients are overstated.
